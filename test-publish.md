# Publishing Test Status

## Current Issues Found:

1. **Authentication**: ✅ Fixed - Using `auth()` instead of `await auth()`
2. **Category Creation**: ✅ Fixed - Auto-creates categories if they don't exist
3. **TipTap Editor**: ✅ Fixed - Removed duplicate extensions and added TableIcon
4. **Database Schema**: ✅ Verified - All required fields present

## Publishing Flow:

1. **Content Editor** → Calls `handleSave()` with status "PUBLISHED"
2. **Form Data** → Includes title, content, categoryId, status, etc.
3. **Server Action** → `createArticle()` processes the form data
4. **Database** → Article saved with proper category relationship
5. **Revalidation** → Pages refreshed to show new content

## Test Steps:

1. Go to `/admin/content/news` (or any content type)
2. Click "Create News Article"
3. Fill in:
   - Title: "Test Article"
   - Content: "This is a test article"
   - Category: Will auto-map to "news"
4. Click "Publish"
5. Check if article appears in `/news` page

## Expected Result:
- Article should be saved to database with status "PUBLISHED"
- Article should appear on the correct category page
- No server errors should occur

## Current Status: 
**READY FOR TESTING** - All major issues have been resolved.
